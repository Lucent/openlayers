# This file includes a small subset of OpenLayers code, designed to be
# integrated into another application. It includes only the Layer types
# necessary to create tiled or untiled WMS, and does not include any Controls.
# This is the result of what was at the time called "Webmap.js" at the FOSS4G
# Web Mapping BOF.
